## ChatBot

Keywords: NLTK, wordnet, TF-IDF, Cosine similarity

Building a ChatBot using NLTK, wordnet and TF-IDF vectorizer.

#### NLTK :
  NLTK is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning, wrappers for industrial-strength NLP libraries.

#### TF-IDF:
  TF-IDF is an abbreviation for Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency. This is very common algorithm to transform text into a meaningful representation of numbers which is used to fit machine algorithm for prediction.

#### Cosine similarity:
  Cosine similarity measures the similarity between two vectors of an inner product space. It is measured by the cosine of the angle between two vectors and determines whether two vectors are pointing in roughly the same direction. It is often used to measure document similarity in text analysis.

  Inputs from user will be compared to the set of frequently asked questions (FAQ). Most relevent answer will be selected using a cosine similarity.
All the frequently asked questions and answers are present in a word file. More questions and answers can be added to improve the performance of ChatBot.
ChatBot will begine conversation with greetings like "hi", "hello".
